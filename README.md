This is a project using publically available data from https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data . In which I took all Magic: The Gathering Cards in existence cleaned the information removing what I deemed to extraneous information and attempted a multitude of machine learning models to see if it was possible to determine if one could predict the price of these cards based off of determinable game effect of these trading cards. I performed Multinomial Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Tensorflow deep learning, Random Forest Classifiers and K Nearest Neighbors Classifiers to see if there was a relationship to examine. In all cases there was a reasonable amount of accuracy of approximately 95% for most models. However when fed data about newer cards and asked to extrapolate all of the models were not matching reality likely because there are other factors such as scarcity that impact card price.
